Privacy Policy

Introduction

Adaptive Vol (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our app, Adaptive Vol, which adjusts your device volume based on time, environment, calendar events, and other user-configured settings.

By using Adaptive Vol, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

Information We Collect

1. Personal Information

	•	Adaptive Vol does not collect, store, or share any personal information (e.g., name, email address, phone number) from users.

2. Non-Personal Information

	•	The app may collect non-personal information that is necessary for the app to function properly. This includes:
	•	Location Data (Environment-based Volume Control): The app may access location data to adjust the volume based on environmental settings (e.g., lowering volume in quiet areas like churches and increasing it in busy streets). This data is used locally on the device and is not stored or shared.
	•	Calendar Data (Event-based Volume Control): The app may access your calendar (Google/Outlook) to adjust the volume during scheduled events (e.g., meetings). Calendar data is used locally on the device to apply volume settings and is not stored or shared.
	•	Device Settings: The app may access device information to adjust volume based on time or other user-configured settings. No sensitive data from the device is collected or shared.

How We Use Information

The data we access is used solely for the purpose of delivering the features of the Adaptive Vol app:

	•	To automatically adjust the volume based on the time of day (e.g., silent mode during night/office hours).
	•	To adjust volume based on environmental noise levels (e.g., lowering volume in quiet areas and raising it in busy environments).
	•	To adjust volume during scheduled calendar events (e.g., meetings).
	•	To intelligently resolve conflicts between different volume configurations (e.g., calendar event vs. environment).

Data Storage and Security

	•	No Data Storage: We do not store or collect any personal information or non-personal information on external servers. All data, including location and calendar information, is processed locally on the device and not shared with any third parties.
	•	Security: We take security seriously and implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the data used by the app from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.

Third-Party Services

Adaptive Vol does not share your information with any third-party services. The app operates independently and does not connect to any external servers or services to collect or share data.

User Control

Users have complete control over the permissions granted to Adaptive Vol. You can:

	•	Revoke Permissions: You can revoke access to location data, calendar data, and other device settings at any time through your device’s settings.
	•	Uninstall the App: You can uninstall Adaptive Vol at any time to stop any further usage of device resources.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
